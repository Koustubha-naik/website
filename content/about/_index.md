Hi, Iâ€™m Koustubha ðŸ‘¾
Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

Iâ€™m someone who loves exploring the world of cybersecurity, especially red teaming â€” which means learning how hackers think and act, so we can understand how to protect systems better.

This blog is like my personal tech journal â€” a space where I write down everything I learn, try out new ideas, and share the tools or projects I build along the way. I also like keeping things clean and minimal, both in design and in how I approach tech.

What youâ€™ll find here:
ðŸ§  Notes from what Iâ€™m learning

ðŸ’» Tools I build and how-tos

ðŸ”¥ Random curiosities I dive into

Thanks for visiting â€” hope you find something useful or inspiring here.
Stay curious, stay sharp.
