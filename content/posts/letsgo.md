# 'My Cybersecurity Journey: Kicking Off with HTB CPTS Certification'

Hey there! This is my first blog post, and Iâ€™m officially divingðŸ¤¿ into the world of cybersecurityâ€”with the **Hack The Box (CPTS) certification** as my first step.

## Why HTB CPTS?

Honestly? Itâ€™s **only $210**, and the **certificate design is cool as f\*\*\***(Design OPðŸ™ƒ). Hack The Box gives you hands-on experience in a controlled environment where you can test real-world hacking techniques. Itâ€™s not just about theoryâ€”it's about actually **doing**.Hacking ainâ€™t about ticking boxes âœ… â€” itâ€™s about figuring stuff out like a boss ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Say what you want, but all the HTB certs look crazy cool ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

## Certification Roadmap

Iâ€™m not picking certs randomlyâ€”these things cost ðŸ’°, and Iâ€™ve still got OSCP on my radar. So yeah, it is what it is ðŸ™ƒ. If u want cybersecurity certification roadmap (means u does't know which cert to take first after that which )its down here ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

ðŸ”— [Paul Jerimy's Security Certification Roadmap](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/)

This roadmap is a visual guide that maps out various cybersecurity certifications. If you're looking for a certification path in any fieldâ€”offensive security, risk management, networking, etc.â€”everything's there.

**Fun Fact ðŸ‘‰** After visiting that website, I got to know about **OSEE** ðŸ˜³ **OSEE**

## My Study Plan 
 
 This is nothing fancyâ€”just how I broke down all the **CPTS** topics into parts that make sense for meâ€”helps me stay on track and not feel overwhelmed.
 
### **Part 1: Getting Started**

| Topic | What It Means |
|-------|----------------|
| Penetration Testing Basics | This is where you learn the fundamentals of hacking. You need to understand the mindset behind penetration testingâ€”how to approach testing systems for vulnerabilities and how hackers exploit them for ethical reasons. |
| Using Nmap to Find Computers | **Nmap** is your go-to tool for scanning networks. It helps you identify live hosts, open ports, and services on a network, giving you a blueprint of what you're dealing with. |

---

### **Part 2: Finding Information**

| Topic | What It Means |
|-------|----------------|
| Footprinting | This is the first step in gathering information about a target. It involves looking up domain names, email addresses, social media profiles, and public databases to gather as much information as possible. |
| Info from Websites | By scraping or manually collecting data from a targetâ€™s website, you can uncover clues about their internal network, technologies they use, and even hidden vulnerabilities. |

---

### **Part 3: Finding Weaknesses & Exploiting Them**

| Topic | What It Means |
|-------|----------------|
| Finding Weaknesses | Vulnerability scanning is all about identifying flaws in a system that can be exploited. This involves using automated tools and manual techniques to find weaknesses in a system's defenses. |
| Transferring Files | When conducting a penetration test, transferring files like payloads and scripts between systems is necessary. This can be done through different methods like HTTP, FTP, or SMB. |
| Shells & Payloads | After finding vulnerabilities, the next step is to establish a shell or payload that gives you control over the system. Tools like **Netcat** or **Metasploit** make this process easier. |

---

### **Part 4: Hacking Services & Passwords**

| Topic | What It Means |
|-------|----------------|
| Using Metasploit | **Metasploit** is one of the most powerful tools in a penetration testerâ€™s arsenal. It helps automate the exploitation of vulnerabilities, making the process quicker and more efficient. |
| Guessing Passwords | Brute-forcing passwords is a classic attack. Tools like **Hydra** or **Burp Suite** can help automate this process by testing common passwords or dictionary-based attacks. |
| Breaking into Services | Services like **SSH**, **FTP**, or **RDP** are often the targets of brute-force or known-vulnerability attacks. By compromising these services, you can gain access to a system. |

---

### **Part 5: Hacking Websites**

| Topic | What It Means |
|-------|----------------|
| Attacking Websites with Ffuf | **Ffuf** is a fast web fuzzer used to discover hidden directories, files, or other resources on a website that might be vulnerable to attack. |
| SQL Injection | **SQL Injection** is one of the oldest but still effective attacks on websites. By manipulating database queries, attackers can retrieve sensitive information from a database. |
| SQLMap | **SQLMap** automates the process of exploiting SQL injection flaws. Itâ€™s a powerful tool for anyone who needs to perform database-based attacks. |
| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | **XSS** attacks allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by others. This is a common attack method for stealing user credentials or session tokens. |
| File Attacks | Uploading malicious files (like web shells) to a server is another way to compromise a site. Once the file is executed, you can gain access to the system. |
| Command Injection | Command injection attacks occur when a web application executes system commands from user input. By manipulating this input, you can execute arbitrary commands on the server. |

---

### **Part 6: Gaining Control** 

| Topic | What It Means |
|-------|----------------|
| Linux Privilege Escalation | This is about gaining higher-level access on Linux systems. Common techniques involve exploiting misconfigurations or using local exploits. |
| Windows Privilege Escalation | Privilege escalation on Windows systems often involves exploiting vulnerable services or insecure permissions to gain admin-level access. |
| Pivoting & Port Forwarding | After compromising a system, you may need to pivot to other systems on the network. **Port forwarding** lets you access systems hidden behind firewalls or NATs. |

---

### **Part 7: Writing Reports & Big Targets**

| Topic | What It Means |
|-------|----------------|
| Writing Reports | A major part of penetration testing is documenting your findings. This involves creating detailed reports of vulnerabilities found and suggesting mitigation strategies. |
| Hacking Big Networks | Penetration testing isnâ€™t just for small systems. Youâ€™ll need to know how to assess large enterprise networks, dealing with things like Active Directory, firewalls, and other complex security infrastructure. |

## What's Next?

So far, played a few beginner boxes on HTB, and itâ€™s realy fun !! ( until or unless u get it ðŸ˜‚ ). The process is been all about scanning, finding weak spots, and exploiting them. THEN BOOM ðŸ’¥

Each challenge teaches something new, and i would like to dive deeper. Once I pass HTB **CPTS**, Iâ€™ll move on to **CBBH**, **PNPT (maybe)**, and eventually **OSCP**. Not sure how i will go but its going to start with **CPTS** and not end with **OSCP** because lets decide what to do after **OSCP** ðŸ˜„
